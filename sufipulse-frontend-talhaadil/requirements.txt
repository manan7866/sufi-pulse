# This is a placeholder requirements.txt for any Python dependencies
# that might be used in the build process or scripts
# For a Next.js application, Python is typically not required
# but included here in case build scripts need Python tools

# Example Python dependencies (uncomment if needed):
# requests==2.31.0
# python-dotenv==1.0.0
